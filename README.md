# WATRES: Watershed Transit Time Estimation

WATRES is a Python package designed to estimate transit time distributions (TTDs) of watersheds. WATRES offers tools for analyzing water transport and residence times using robust computational methods. Visit the full documentation at [quentin-duchemin.github.io/WATRES](https://quentin-duchemin.github.io/WATRES/).
